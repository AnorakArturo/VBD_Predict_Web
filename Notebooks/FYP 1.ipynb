Many of these vectors are bloodsucking insects, which ingest disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host (human or animal) and later transmit it into a new host, after the pathogen has replicated. Often, once a vector becomes infectious, they are capable of transmitting the pathogen for the rest of their life during each subsequent bite/blood meal.\n","\n","Vector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted by vectors. Every year there are more than 700,000 deaths from vector borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile Fever."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XOVgOnWUM-uO"},"source":["## Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","import seaborn as
